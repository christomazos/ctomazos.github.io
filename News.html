       <center><h3><em><font size="4" color="red"><strong>EMSB RECORDS HIGHEST SUCCESS RATE AMONG QUEBEC PUBLIC SCHOOLS</strong></font></em></h3></center>
       
       
       <p1>MONTREAL, SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 – For the second year in a row the English Montreal School Board has recorded the highest success (graduation) rate in the entire province of Quebec among public school boards, figures released by  The Ministère de l’Education, de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche (MEESR) show.

The 87.9 percent mark is based on a seven year cohort, meaning it followed the progression of students from 2007 to their graduating year in 2014. It is in line with last year’s total of 87.8 percent.

 “This is all the more impressive given the fact the province-wide graduation rate is 77.7 percent,” stated EMSB Chairman Angela Mancini. “The good news was made possible thanks to everyone associated with the EMSB, from our staff, parents, volunteers and of course our students.”

As Ms. Mancini emphasizes, “at the EMSB our goal is to ensure that all students achieve their full potential, and our diverse programs ensure enrichment for those who need it and remediation for others. The challenge of our pedagogues is to help each and every one of our students.  An 87.9 percent success rate is a testimony to how our board, through a variety of initiatives, is achieving this goal. It is the firm commitment to our strategic plan and partnership agreements that make this success possible. Our phenomenal success rate is due to team work and perseverance.  It is the strength of our team that makes us a great board.”

Stated EMSB Director General Ann Marie Matheson: “We must congratulate our teaching staff for their hard work and dedication! They are second to none. We are fortunate as well to have such a great team of consultants at the head office who work directly with teachers in each subject area. Our Department of Educational and Technology Services is very much in tune with what our schools need.”

In its Partnership Agreement with the Ministry, the EMSB had a goal of 86 percent for the graduating class of 2014 and 88 percent for 2020. “We have surpassed that target and have almost reached our 2020 objective,” EMSB Director of Educational and Technology Services Sandra Furfaro said with pride.  
To put the EMSB’s present student success rates in full perspective, the average success rate among all Quebec schools (public and private) is 77.7 percent while it stands at 73.8 percent for public schools only.
